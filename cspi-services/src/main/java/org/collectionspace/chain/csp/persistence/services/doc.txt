This packages implements Storage (SVCAPP API) for the Services layer. See the storage package for details. At the moment
it is made grottier by the presence of some hacks to fix what's actually often an issue with the application/ui
interconnect.

The direct implementation is ServicesStorage which is an instance of SplittingStorage which at the moment only splits
into ServicesCollectionObjectStorage. ServicesCollectionObjectStorage implements storage for collection object, and will
probably be supplemented by similar classes for other services. However, as we add these, common factors will emerge
which will allow them to be refactored into a common base class (or similar), meaning that 
ServicesCollectionObjectStorage and similar just end up with special code for a particular interface.

The actual REST calls are handled by ServicesConnection, which uses utility types ReturnedDocument and ReturnedURL
to return things along with status codes, etc. Less than ideal: answers on a postcard, please.

ServicesIdentifierMap is a class designed to deal with the "when are csid's generated" issue and will go when that's
resolved.
