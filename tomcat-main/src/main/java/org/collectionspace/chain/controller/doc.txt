This package is currently the controller for the webapp. This will evolve, over time, into an implementation of the
APPUI API between the generic app layer and the UI layer. Even the API is, as yet, unwritten. So for now you've got
a bog-standard controller.

ChainServlet -- This is the servlet proper.
ChainRequest -- This is an abstraction of the request and response which translates things expressed in web-language -
                  servlets, request parameters, pathinfo, etc - into ours - request type, operation, etc.
Config       -- Encapsulates configuration discovery and reporting.
RequestType  -- An enumeration of operations.

At the moment ChainServlet contains way too much hardwired junk. Obviously this will naturally disassemble as the
APPUI API develops, and we're required to parameterise more things. The same is true of Config which contains a method
for each option at the moment, which is unsustainable.

ChainServlet is the main way out of this package via calls to .schema (for schemas) and .storage (for data store).
